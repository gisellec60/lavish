      <h3>So, What is it?</h3>
      <p className="text-style">"I think it is a mix of pop culture dance and other expressions 
        through movement that is done on the fields with a marching band," 
        said Traci Greene, coach of the Southern University Dancing Dolls and 
        a former Dancing Doll majorette herself.

        Majorette dancers mix multiple styles of dancing, including jazz, hip-hop,
        ballet, burlesque, cabaret, kick lines and more, to entertain audiences while
        simultaneously honoring the dancers who came before them. "I think if you can
        define it, it's a dancer who cannot be defined," said Sydney Clark, a fourth-year
        member of North Carolina A&T State University's Golden Delight auxiliary majorette
        team. "It's a person who is doing things with their body that physically or mentally
        you can't really comprehend, but physically you can't take your eyes off of them."</p>
